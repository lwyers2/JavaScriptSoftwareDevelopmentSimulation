Sift is an American IT company that creates their own products for digital trust & saftey. Its solutions help big companies track illegal fraud actions. Due to fast developments, Sift decided to hire a dedicated development team in Ukraine with the help of Alcor as their recruitment services provider. Our top headhunters took care of the recruitment process to hire tech specialists with rate skills. Our recruiters hired 17 specialists for Sift in less than a year, and as a result the patron got its team of specialists with a unique stack. The company uses Scrum with 2-week sprints, and its Ukranian software engineers are in different teams that are responsible for different areas of product development. Thus, 5 senior back-end developers extended their API team, while other back & front-end developers joined the core product development team.

2. Specialist
