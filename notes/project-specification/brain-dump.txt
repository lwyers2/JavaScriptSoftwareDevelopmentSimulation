Studying conversion gives essential skills in understanding the core tenents of software development. However these real-life skills may seem abstract in when first going into a software developer role, whether that is in a dedicated softare house, or a development team for a specific business enterprise. 

To give students a better understanding of how a software company works on a day to day basis, this tool aims at creating a simulation of daily processes that are involved in the procrurment and development of software. Understanding how projects are initially won by companies, and following the exact processes that are involved in developing these products will help give students a greater understanding of develpment processes as whole within a real life setting. 

Outcomes of numerous events determine how well this process will go. Determining these individual events and how they may impact on other events is key when discussing this project.

Much of how companies find clients is very dependent on the company itself. If a company is a start-up specialising in a specific software, they are geared to finding customers of their product. If a company works on bespoke products, they may have a marketing team that will create emailing lists and attend networking events to get the product out there.
