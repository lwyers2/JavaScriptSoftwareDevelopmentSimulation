auto allocating - moving into simulation- move that into a seperate file
at the simulation stage - various factors 

theory about why events occur. 
allocate staf to ticket is in main story aka app
then in different file there will be a determination

In the story record WHAT happens
Simulation will be can happen

same with negotiations 
in the simulation side use random number generator. 

keep them seperate. 
in simulation put in a set of parameters put in variables that can be learned 

one thing to add - 

if the time pruposed was wrong then have that in the story.

have a little function called time has passed

everytime time passes, wante to save out a copy of your data. 
end up with an arry of whole data structure - want to createe a webpage that will show this information. See the story the story as it progresses. Visualisation of the story. 

What has happened over time. 

Gives me a demo able thing - mostly going to focus on the story. 
narrating in this formal code based way the changes that
to test this - two projects that are real .
do with the second one - try replicating it, by changing the order. 
I have successfylly formalised how software business operate. 
visual webpage where you show simply.
Dropdown of webpage showing each sprint - show print out of each array. 
Hopefully find that when 
having the functions reflect what has actually happened. 

Still 

Then in simulation - what causes that and 

Key thing is - need about three weeks to write up.
